my eyeballs have a hard time staying on a single line of text sometimes, so i wrote a thing to help me with that.

it might behave a bit jank sometimes.

unsupported things:
- on mouseclick, things should happen?
- might add some options to this later?

bugs:
- copy/paste line numbering is weird, might be due to some lovely event handling stuff
